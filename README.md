#Project Summary

The goal of this project was to improve upon existing machine learning algorithms that predict the outcome of Supreme Court cases that use metadata about past cases or the text of oral arguments.

The two models that were tested were: 
  
(1) an Extra Trees Random Forest Classifier applied to metadata of Supreme Court cases from the Supreme Court Database and

(2) a Support Vector Classifier applied to the oral arguments of Supreme Court cases.
